# Instabridge

## Educational Purpose

This project was created primarily for **educational and learning purposes**.  
While it is well-structured and could technically be used in production, it is **not intended for commercialization**.  
The main goal is to explore and demonstrate best practices, patterns, and technologies in software development.

## Description

**Instabridge** is a RESTful backend API built with Node.js, TypeScript, and Express that acts as a structured and efficient bridge between your application and the Instagram Graph API (`https://graph.instagram.com`).

The API handles the full authentication and data retrieval flow required to interact with Instagram's platform. It resolves a user's Instagram ID from a given access token, caches both the token and the user ID in Redis to avoid redundant calls to the Instagram API on every request, and exposes clean endpoints to retrieve profile information such as username, account type, and media count.

The caching layer built on Redis ensures that once the authentication flow is completed, subsequent requests are fast and do not repeatedly hit the external Instagram API. The session is persisted across requests using Redis as a key-value store, meaning the app maintains state without requiring a traditional database.

The project follows a layered architecture separating concerns into controllers, services, DAOs, middlewares, and configuration modules. Request validation is handled through middlewares that verify the presence of a valid access token and a resolved user ID before allowing access to protected endpoints. Error handling is centralized and consistent across the entire application.

It is fully containerized with Docker, includes separate environments for development (with hot-reload via nodemon), production (multi-stage build), and testing (isolated Redis instance). The test suite uses Jest with Supertest for integration testing against the real application stack.

## Getting Started

### Run with Docker

> **Requirements:** [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) must be installed.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values (see [Env Keys](#env-keys) for a full reference and [Instagram Credentials](#instagram-credentials) for how to obtain the Meta-issued secrets).
4. Build the Docker images: `docker-compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml build --no-cache`
5. Start the containers: `docker-compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml up --force-recreate`

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5050`.

### Run without Docker

> **Requirements:** Node.js `>=22` and a Redis instance reachable from your machine (e.g. a local install or a standalone `docker run -p 6379:6379 redis:7.0`).

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and point the hosts at your local services — most importantly `REDIS_HOST=localhost` instead of the compose hostname `redis`.
4. Start the API in watch mode: `npm run dev` (or `npm run build` + `npm start` for the compiled build).

At startup the server verifies connectivity against Redis with capped exponential-backoff retries. If Redis is unreachable it only **warns** — the server keeps running and the Redis client reconnects on its own once the service is back. If you see those warnings, check that Redis is up and that `REDIS_HOST`/`REDIS_PORT` in your `.env` point to it.

## Environment Files

Environment variables are loaded by `src/configs/dotenv.config.ts` from a cascade of `.env` files before the Zod schema validates them. Precedence, highest first:

1. Real environment variables (Docker `env_file`, CI, shell) — never overridden by any file.
2. `.env.<NODE_ENV>.local`
3. `.env.local`
4. `.env.<NODE_ENV>`
5. `.env`

`NODE_ENV` itself resolves from the process environment first, then from `.env.local`, then from `.env`, and defaults to `development`.

**Test mode is special:** when `NODE_ENV=test` only `.env.test.local` and `.env.test` are read, so a local `.env` used for development can never affect the test suite.

The list of files that were actually applied is exported as `loadedEnvFiles` from `src/configs/env.config.ts` and logged in the server startup line (`envFiles: [...]`), so you can always see where your configuration came from. All `.env.*` variants except `.env.example` are git-ignored and docker-ignored.

## Env Keys

The application reads the following variables from the environment at startup, filling in anything missing from the [env file cascade](#environment-files). Values are validated with Zod and the process exits if a required variable is missing or invalid.

## Instagram Credentials

The two Meta-issued values above (`INSTAGRAM_SECRET_CLIENT` and `INSTAGRAM_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN`) require creating an app in the Meta Developer Portal. The steps below walk through that process.

### How to obtain `INSTAGRAM_SECRET_CLIENT` and `INSTAGRAM_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN`

#### 1. Create a Meta App

1. Go to [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com) and log in.
2. Click **My Apps → Create App**.
3. Select **Other** as the use case, then choose **Business** as the app type.
4. Fill in the app name and contact email, then click **Create App**.

#### 2. Add the Instagram Product

1. In your app dashboard, scroll down to **Add Products to Your App**.
2. Find **Instagram** and click **Set Up**.

#### 3. Get the App Secret (`INSTAGRAM_SECRET_CLIENT`)

1. Go to **App Settings → Basic**.
2. Click **Show** next to **App Secret** and copy the value.
3. Set it as `INSTAGRAM_SECRET_CLIENT` in your `.env`.

#### 4. Add a Test User and generate the Access Token (`INSTAGRAM_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN`)

1. In the left sidebar, go to **Instagram → API Setup with Instagram Login** (or **Basic Display**).
2. Scroll to **User Token Generator** and click **Add or Remove Instagram Testers**.
3. Invite your Instagram account as a tester.
4. Accept the invitation from your Instagram account: go to **Settings → Apps and Websites → Tester Invites**.
5. Back in the developer dashboard under **User Token Generator**, click **Generate Token** next to your account.
6. Authorize the app and copy the generated token.
7. Set it as `INSTAGRAM_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN` in your `.env`.

> **Note:** User access tokens expire. If the API starts returning 400 errors, generate a new token and update your `.env`. You will also need to run `docker exec -it <redis-container> redis-cli FLUSHALL` so the new token replaces the cached one.

## Endpoints

With the environment configured and the containers running, the server exposes the following routes.

The required call order is: **auth first, then instagram routes**. The auth endpoint resolves and caches the user ID in Redis. Instagram endpoints require both a valid access token and a cached user ID to work.

### Health

| Method | Route                  | Auth required |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ------------- |
| GET    | `/api/v1/health/live`  | No            |
| GET    | `/api/v1/health/ready` | No            |

**`GET /api/v1/health/live`**
Liveness probe. Returns `{ "code": "SUCCESS_HEALTH_LIVE", "message": "Service is alive.", "data": null }` when the process is up. Used by the production Docker `HEALTHCHECK`.

**`GET /api/v1/health/ready`**
Readiness probe. Returns `{ "code": "SUCCESS_HEALTH_READY", "message": "Service is ready.", "data": null }` when the service is ready to accept traffic.

---

### Auth

| Method | Route                  | Auth required |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ------------- |
| GET    | `/api/v1/auth/user_id` | Access token  |

Resolves the Instagram user ID from the configured access token and caches it in Redis. **Must be called once before using any Instagram endpoint.**

---

### Instagram

| Method | Route                            | Auth required          |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/v1/instagram/alive`        | Access token + user ID |
| GET    | `/api/v1/instagram/user/profile` | Access token + user ID |

**`GET /api/v1/instagram/alive`**
Returns API metadata (author, version).

**`GET /api/v1/instagram/user/profile`**
Returns the Instagram profile of the authenticated user: `id`, `username`, `account_type`, `media_count`.

## Testing

The test suite exercises the endpoints above end-to-end against a real (isolated) Redis instance using Jest and Supertest.

1. Navigate to the project folder
2. Execute: `npm test`

For coverage report:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## Continuous Integration

The repository ships with a **GitHub Actions** pipeline defined in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml). It runs automatically on every `push` and `pull_request` targeting the `main` branch.

### Pipeline overview

```
                      ┌─── PR or push to main ───┐
                      ▼                          ▼
┌──────────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────────┐
│   lint-and-audit     │─▶│       test       │─▶│     docker-build     │
│ eslint · prettier ·  │  │  jest --runInBand│  │ Dockerfile.dev/prod  │
│ type-check · audit   │  │  + redis (docker)│  │ (matrix, no push)    │
└──────────────────────┘  └──────────────────┘  └──────────────────────┘
```

Each job depends on the previous one through `needs:`, so a failure in `lint-and-audit` short-circuits `test`, and a failure in `test` short-circuits `docker-build`.

### Validation jobs (run on every PR and push)

1. **`lint-and-audit`** — `npm run lint` (ESLint with `typescript-eslint` strict + stylistic), `npm run format:check` (Prettier), `npm run type-check` (`tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit`) and `npm audit --audit-level=high`.
2. **`test`** — `npm test` runs the full Jest suite (`--runInBand --verbose`). The global setup spins up the isolated Redis container declared in `test.docker-compose.yml`; the teardown brings it down with `down -v --remove-orphans`.
3. **`docker-build`** — uses `docker/setup-buildx-action` + `docker/build-push-action` with a matrix over `Dockerfile.development` (tag `app:dev`) and `Dockerfile.production` (tag `app:prod`) to smoke-build both images in parallel. Images are **not pushed** to any registry.

The production image also defines a runtime `HEALTHCHECK` against `/api/v1/health/live`, so a green `docker-build` is a strong signal that the container will report healthy.

### Node version pinning

All jobs use `actions/setup-node@v4` with `node-version-file: ".nvmrc"`, so the CI Node version is whatever is written in [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc) (currently `22`). To upgrade Node across the project, bump `.nvmrc` and the `engines.node` field in `package.json` together — `.npmrc` ships with `engine-strict=true` so a mismatch fails the install locally.

### Running the same checks locally

```bash
# lint-and-audit
npm run lint
npm run format:check
npm run type-check
npm audit --audit-level=high

# test (needs Docker for the isolated Redis container)
npm test

# docker-build (matrix, locally)
docker build -f Dockerfile.development -t app:dev .
docker build -f Dockerfile.production  -t app:prod .
```

### Skipping CI

To push a change without triggering the workflow (typo fixes, doc-only commits, etc.) use GitHub's standard marker in the commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "docs: fix typo in README [skip ci]"
```

## Security Audit

Beyond runtime tests, dependencies should be audited regularly for known vulnerabilities.

### npm audit

Check for vulnerabilities in dependencies:

```bash
npm audit
```

Fix vulnerabilities automatically (when a safe upgrade exists):

```bash
npm audit fix
```

## Known Issues

None at the moment.
